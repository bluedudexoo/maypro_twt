# Maypro!!- #Maypro2022

## What is Maypro? 
-An annual celebration and opportunity to show off your cool Kaypro
setups/projects/etc
-A chance to lovingly tease Kaypro's incredibly confusing numbering system

## Loose guidelines for the annual #Maypro20XX hashtag:
-Week 1: WIPs- restoring a board? Making the CRT behave? Cleaning out a
keyboard? This is your time to shine!

-Week 2: Glamour shots- Show off your Kaypro drip and aesthetic visions
brought to life!

-Week 3: Software- Wrote some cool programs for CP/M or your own OS for the
Kaypro? Doing cool terminal stuff with other computers? Keep us in the loop!
:)

-Week 4: History- Learn something cool about your Kaypro's history, or the
company? Did you ever work for Kaypro? Share your stories!

If there's a little overhang into a fifth week or something, that can be
used as a free-for-all time. Naturally, these are very loose categories for
each week, so if you want to show something else Kaypro-related or ignore 
them entirely, feel free! Just make sure you tag #Maypro2022 so we can
retweet it to our Maypro twitter account! 

That's it for now, happy computing!
